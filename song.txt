Talksick3 in the fall
I'm the new album, you're the same song
They say I'm sick! and it won't take a long
Till my sickness spreads worldwide

They call me the freak of the fall
You feel like a badboy? Well I'm King Kong
I'm the new high and you're the same bong
I know I'm, I know I'm hot don't cry
Talksick3 in the fall
I'm the new album, you're the same song
They say I'm sick! and it won't take a long
Till my sickness spreads worldwide

They call me the freak of the fall
You feel like a badboy? Well I'm King Kong
I'm the new high and you're the same bong
I know I'm, I know I'm hot don't cry

Talksick3 in the fall
I'm the new album, you're the same song
They say I'm sick! and it won't take a long
Till my sickness spreads worldwide
